The **graphics compositor** organizes how [scenes](../../game-studio/scenes.md) are rendered. You can use it to customize almost every part of the rendering pipeline. For example, you can:

- use one or multiple cameras
- filter entities in the scene
- render to one or more render targets, with different viewports
- render to a texture used by a material (eg to create a rear-view mirror)
- set HDR or LDR rendering
- apply post effects to a render target, selected before or after rendering a camera
- clear a render target or clear only the depth buffer (eg to always render on top of a render target in a FPS game, or render the UI)
- modify the compositor from scripts (or any animation system), for example to modify post effects

## Create a graphics compositor

Xenko includes a graphics compositor when you create a project.

If you need to create a graphics compositor, in the **asset view**, click **Add asset** and select **Misc > Graphics compositor**.

![Add graphics compositor](media/add-graphics-compositor.png)

You can choose:

* Level 10 (HDR with post effects)
* Level 9 (LDR with no post effects)

These aren't different kinds of graphics compositor, but rather presets you can customize as you need.

## Set the graphics compositor

You can have multiple graphics compositors in your project, but you can only use one compositor at a time. At runtime, Xenko uses the graphics compositor you specify in [Game Settings](../../game-studio/game-settings.md).

![Set default scene](../../game-studio/media/game-settings-graphics-compositor.png)

You can change which graphics compositor your game uses at runtime in a script. 

## Open the graphics compositor editor

>[!Note]
>The graphics compositor editor is an experimental feature. It will be improved in future versions.

In the **asset view** (in the bottom pane by default), double-click the **Graphics Compositor** asset.

![Graphics Compositor asset](media/graphics-compositor-asset.png)

The graphics compositor editor opens.

## Nodes

The graphics compositor is divided into **nodes**. You can set the properties of each node in the **property grid** on the right.

### Entry points

In the **Entry Points** node, you configure the pipeline for each entry point.

![Entry points node](media/entry-points-node.png)

There are three entry points:

* **Game**, to render your game
* **Editor**, to render the Game Studio editor
* **Single view** (referred to as **Utility** in the property grid), to render other things, such as [light probes](../lights-and-shadows/light-probes.md) and [cubemaps](../skyboxes.md).

Each entry point can use a separate rendering pipeline. For example, the game and editor might share the same forward renderer and [post-processing effects](../post-effects/index.md) while your single view uses a separate forward renderer.

#### Connect an entry point to a renderer

1. Select the **Entry point** node.

2. In the **property grid**, next to the entry point you want to connect (**Editor**, **Game** or **Utility**), select the renderer you want to connect to.

    ![Select renderer](media/connect-entry-point.png)

For information about the different renderers, see [Scene renders](scene-renderers.md).

### Forward renderer

In a typical setup, the **forward renderer** renders almost everything in your scene. It renders, in order:

1. opaque objects
2. transparent objects
3. [post effects](../post-effects/index.md)

The forward renderer is also where you set VR options. For more information, see [Virtual reality](../../virtual-reality/index.md). You configure the forward renderer properties in the **forward entry node**. 

### Debug renderer

The debug renderer is used by scripts to print debug information.

### Post-processing effects

The **post-processing effects** node comes after the forward renderer and controls the post effects in your game. For more information, see [post-processing effects](../post-effects/index.md).

## Create a node

To create a node, right-click the graphics compositor editor and select the type of node you want to create:

![Create node](../../virtual-reality/media/create-node.png)
