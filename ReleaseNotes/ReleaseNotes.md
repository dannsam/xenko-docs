# Highlights

## Scene hierarchy and scene streaming

Working with scenes has become more flexible. Instead of a single scene, your game can now use a hierarchy of scenes to organize entities into levels, areas or layers, and let teams collaborate on them more efficiently.

Game Studio displays child scenes together with their parent. Individual scenes can be loaded, unload, locked and moved around.

</video>

When running your game, the **default scene** set in your **game settings** is loaded as the **root scene** and can be used to store persistent entities. More scenes can be dynamically loaded and unloaded from scripts and added as **child scenes**.

```
var childScene = Content.Load<Scene>("myChildScene");
SceneSystem.SceneInstance.RootScene.Children.Add(childScene);
```

</video>

To get started, take a look at the new built-in `SceneStreamingScript`. It demonstrates background scene loading when passing through trigger volumes. 

You can now use a scene's `Offset` to move its entities both at design time and runtime.

The `ChildSceneComponent` has been removed. We encourage all entities to be managed by a single **entity manager** and rendered by a single **graphics compositor**.

## Virtual Reality

Enabling VR is now as simple as a single click!

Xenko's clustered forward rendering, with its multisample anti-aliasing, makes it ideal for VR. Xenko uses a single API for every device, with native support for Oculus and HTV Vive (more devices coming very soon).

Xenko comes with a VR game sample that shows you how to implement VR gameplay, including environment interaction and teleportation:

</video>

Save valuable time by visualizing and testing VR directly from the scene editor:

</video>

## Global illumination with light probes

Light probes capture the lighting at the position you place them. They simulate indirect light, the effect of light bouncing off surfaces and illuminating other surfaces.

They can make a dramatic difference to the mood and appearance of your scene.

<video autoplay loop class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/light_probes_640.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/light_probes_640.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Light probes can be **placed freely** and are processed **per pixel**. This means you can use them not only on small dynamic objects, but also large or static objects (until we have light maps for those!).

Last but not least, you can now very easily capture a DDS cubemap from current camera position in editor, for use as a diffuse or specular skybox light.

## Light shafts

Xenko now supports shadow map-based light shafts for directional lights.

<video autoplay loop class="responsive-video" poster="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/lightshaft_CoS_640.jpg">
   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/lightshaft_CoS_640.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Our implementation uses ray-marching rather than post effects, making the shaft visible and cool-looking even if the light source isn't visible.

   <source src="media/ReleaseNotes-2.0/lightshaft_640.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

## Graphics compositor

The graphics compositor is now a separate asset.

Rendering parameters (such as VR) and post effect parameters can be tweaked in just a few clicks.

This is just the first step towards making the graphics compositor easy to customize and extend. Stay tuned for more changes in future releases! 

## Improved Visual Studio experience

We now have full support for **Visual Studio 2017**!

* Xenko Visual Studio extension now supports Visual Studio 2017
* GameStudio recognize Visual Studio 2017.
* Games can use C# 7.0, and our script editor can recognize C# 7.0 and offer C# 7.0 refactoring thanks to Roslyn (you need to make your solution VS2017+ for it to work).
* Our internal `AssemblyProcessor` which perform various operations on generated assemblies can now work with portable PDB (as generated by .NET Standard projects)

Programmers working with Xenko often go back and forth between Game Studio and Visual Studio. To make their lives easier, we made a few key improvements to the Xenko Visual Studio extension:

* You can now open the current solution in Game Studio directly from Visual Studio.
* Syntax highlighting didn't behave well when switching theme.
* Previously, when assets are compiling, MSBuild didn't report any progress until finished. It now displays information, warnings and errors while it compiles.

Also, our whole build infrastructure and script editor is now based on the latest version of MSBuild 2017 and Roslyn. Supporting the new VS2017 Project System with .NET Standard is just a few steps away!

## Faster & lighter

In order to provide a better experience for users, we've been working hard on various fronts to make the editor smoother and more responsive. This is still a work in progress and expect regular progress.

Also, package size has been almost divided by 3, resulting in much faster download and install time.

# Breaking changes

## Backward compatibility

Xenko 2.0 supports project upgrades only for projects created with Xenko 1.10 Beta. If you want to upgrade a project made with an older version, update it to Xenko 1.10 first.

## Visual Studio support

Xenko 2.0 supports Visual Studio 2015 and Visual Studio 2017 as IDEs. Visual Studio 2013 and earlier versions are no longer supported. 

When upgrading a project from earlier version, in its `.csproj` file, set `ToolsVersion="14.0"` as the minimum required version.

## Navigation

All compontents related to navigation have been moved to their own `SiliconStudio.Xenko.Navigation` assembly and namespace.

## Graphics Compositor

Previously, rendering pipeline was customized by magic `IPipelinePlugin` at runtime. This was very hard to control. Now, most of the pipeline configuration happens  at design time in the new Graphics Compositor asset.

`RenderFrame` is gone. Renderer are typically declaring and allocating render targets.

## Version 2.0.1.1

Release date 2017/4/28

### Issues fixed

#### Game Studio

* Fixed a potential crash when enabling VR in the editor and opening multiple scenes/prefabs
* Prevents to drag and drop an entity that depends on a prefab into it (or an ancestor prefab) that would have created a cyclic reference and crashed the editor
* Fixed an issue with automatic assembly reload

#### Engine

* Fixed a crash when computing light probes

#### Build

* Fixed a possible issue when compiling a game that targets iOS and the right Xamarin version cannot be found
 
# Known Issues

* On Linux, when switching the underlying Graphics Platform, rendering doesn't occur or fail. To fix the problem, delete the cache, local, and roaming folders on the Linux host and restart the game.
* Performance issues on mobile (being worked on)
* On iOS, if `Enable device-specific builds` is toggled on (from the project properties), it's not possible to debug game code. To speed up your development manually select the architecture of your device from the Advanced tab.
* Live scripting has been temporarily disabled
